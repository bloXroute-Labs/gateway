# Contributing to bloXroute

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to bloXroute and reading this document.

The goal of this document is to capture some general guidelines and be a useful reference for anyone interested in
contributing to the bloXroute ecosystem. Treat the following content as recommendations, not hard rules. Use your best
judgment and feel free to propose changes – this document will always be a work in progress.

## Conduct

Be nice. You can refer to the [Contributor Covenant] for more detail.

## Communication

Join [our Discord]! You can meet our developer team there to get a sense of what open issues there are that you can
contribute to and chat broadly about the bloXroute system. Try to avoid filing Github issues just for a question –
you'll get faster results by talking with us directly in Discord.

## Contributor Workflow

Once you have an issue to work on, you should take the following general steps:

1. [Fork] the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Write code and create commits
4. Open a pull request against the upstream repo.

Make sure your pull request passes all builds and add the following users as reviewers:
* [aspin]
* [Uri-Margalit-bloXroute][urim]
* [offerm]

They will help delegate reviews and merge the PR.

## Style Guide

We primarily adhere to [effective_go][style]:


## Builds / Testing

Please make sure your changes include sufficient unit and/or integration test coverage to prove that your code works
properly. Also, be sure to run the existing unit tests and make sure those pass.
